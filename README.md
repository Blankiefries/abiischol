#Antititvirus Heboh
This is a command-line antivirus program for Windows created by ABIISCHOL. The program scans all hard drives and files for viruses and malware and deletes any infected files found. However, this code is not a functional antivirus program but rather a prank that creates fake virus alerts and deletes important files.

#Usage
To use the program, simply run the batch file "AntiTitvirusHeboh.bat". The program will prompt the user to input whether they want to check for viruses or not. If the user chooses to check for viruses, the program will proceed with the fake virus scan and display fake virus alerts. It will then delete important files and create random files on the user's desktop. Finally, it will display a message informing the user that they have been pranked.

#Disclaimer
This code is not a functional antivirus program and is only intended for entertainment purposes. It is not recommended to run this code on your computer as it may cause harm to your files and system.
